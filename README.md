# Alangorithms
A subset of students in Marist College's CMPT-435 algorithms class decided to compete with each 
other for the fastest runtime. This is all in good fun to motivate each other to achieve our best
work. This repository details the rules for submission and records the results for reach assignment.

## Repository Structure
This file is the main README. To prevent it from getting too bogged down there is a separate 
markdown file for the specifications and results of each assignment. These are all located in the 
root directory of the repository.

`/Assignments` Is for storing copies of the assignment PDFs so that anyone who sees this repository
can try them for themselves. This also serves as an archive in case 
[the class website](http://www.labouseur.com/courses/algorithms/) goes down.

`/Datasets` Stores the data used to test the algorithms. Shoutout to Dan Gisolfi for finding the
larger dataset for us to test with, which originally came from 
[here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

`/Scripts` Contains all the scripts used to test programs.

There is also AssignmentTemplate.md, which is used as the baseline for detailing each assignment.
Anyone is free to use this format for their own use.

## Testing Hardware
All runtimes are from a Raspberry Pi Zero W running Raspbian Strech Lite.

This hardware was chosen because of its low performance (compared to the machines most people 
develop on) so that the difference in programs would be very apparent. It is also $5, so it is
very easy for anyone who wants to test their own code against ours to do so.

If you attend Marist and don't want to buy one of your own just contact me and I can test your code
on mine.
